# Continuous-Time Signal Generation in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code to generate and visualize several **fundamental continuous-time signals**.  
The goal of this project is to understand the mathematical definitions of continuous signals and how to represent them visually, which is essential for **signal processing, communication systems, and control engineering**.

## ðŸ“Œ Signals Implemented

The `continuous_signals.m` script generates the following signals:

1. **Unit Impulse Signal (Î´(t))**  
   - A theoretical signal that is 0 everywhere except at `t = 0`, where it is undefined but integrates to 1.  
   - Approximated in MATLAB for visualization.  

2. **Unit Step Signal (u(t))**  
   - Defined as `u(t) = 0` for `t < 0`, and `u(t) = 1` for `t â‰¥ 0`.  

3. **Unit Ramp Signal (r(t))**  
   - Defined as `r(t) = 0` for `t < 0`, and `r(t) = t` for `t â‰¥ 0`.  

4. **Exponential Signal (e^{at})**  
   - General form:  
     \[
     x(t) = e^{a t}
     \]  
   - The code provides both **decaying (`a < 0`)** and **growing (`a > 0`)** exponentials.  

5. **Sinusoidal Signal (sin(Ï‰t), cos(Ï‰t))**  
   - Defined as `sin(2Ï€ft)` or `cos(2Ï€ft)` for frequency `f`.

6. **Sinc Signal**

Defined as:

`sinc(t) = sin(Ï€t) / (Ï€t)`

## ðŸ“Š Simulation Results

The script generates plots of all six continuous-time signals, organized in a **3Ã—2 grid** for easy comparison.  

*(Sample plots will appear here once the script is executed.)*
